# pysurveillance

Somebody stole my bike. I didn't find the security camera or software I wanted, so I tought I'd come up with something simple using opencv, python, and raspberry pi. This is all hacked together in one evening, but it works on a raspberry pi 3 with about 20 fps. 

Features:
- save jpg images when motion detected
- save h.264 codec mp4 files of the latest N detections

This allows me to put the files on a web page and access them over the internet.
